All the frontend applications cannot directly parse the complex data type used in models of the database therefore it is very necessary to convert it into a globally standardized data format like JSON or XML. This channel of the process first involves converting the complex-datatype into python iterable objects generally i.e to dictionaries this process of conversion is called serialization. It becomes very easy to convert python iterable into a JSON or XML object.
